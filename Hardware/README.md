The .sch and .brd files here are designs for the PCB, last updated with Eagle 8.5.0.

Please check the main README for known issues with the current hardware revision version.

Library parts used here are from the [Music Thing Modular parts library by Tom Whitwell](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/MTM-Parts-Library) and the [Sparkfun Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries).

The gerber (currently v0.2) files in the zipped folder have been used to fabricate PCBs from [Seeed Fusion PCB Services](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion.html) and generated with the Seeed Gerber Generator and the board adheres to the Seeed Design Rules, both found [here](http://support.seeedstudio.com/knowledgebase/articles/422482-fusion-pcb-pcba-order-submission-guidelines).
